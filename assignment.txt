# Code Assignment

## Intro
This assignment will be used as a discussion during a technical interview.
Time constraints are part of software development and even though we don't expect a perfect solution, imagine your code to be on its way to production.
If you have to make compromises, provide a README to briefly explain pros and cons of your approach, what considerations you would make for another iteration and in general what your 
future colleagues might be interested in if they had to pick up your code.

The primary values for the code we look for are: simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability. It should be easy to scan the code, and rather quickly understand what itâ€™s doing. 
Pay attention to naming. 

## The Task
The assignment is to implement a warehouse software. This software should hold articles, and the articles should contain an identification number, a name and available stock. 
It should be possible to load articles into the software from a file, see the attached inventory.json.
The warehouse software should also have products, products are made of different articles. Products should have a name, price and a list of articles of which they are made from with a quantity. 
The products should also be loaded from a file, see the attached products.json.

Sample products - products.json.
Sample articles in inventory - inventory.json

The warehouse should have the following functionality;
* Get all products and quantity of each that is available with the current inventory.
* Assess if it's possible to Remove(Sell) a product and from the inventory (actual removing from inventory is not required).

## To do
In order to tailor this assignment for this specific role, here are some specifications:

- Code for just the backend.
- Preferably use Typescript, NodeJS for the REST APIs.
- Setting up database is not required, just read from the given json files, feel free to add more json files if you decide on a different data structure for database.
- If time allows, add some test cases (not mandatory).
- Add a README with clear instructions on how to setup and run the code.
- Whatever can be finished in the given time is great, a fully-functional code is NOT a requirement. This is more for assessing the approach you take, and to act as a base for the technical discussion.
